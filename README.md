This project consiste of using an API which is in this case "https://randomuser.me/".
This could be use for a company for their employee to look through the other employee information.

technical information on the webpage:
  - will generate 12 employee per page with personal informations.
  - by clicking the more info button, it will generate a modal where you will have more information.
  - previous and next buttons will allow you to go throught the list of employee without having to click on each one of them.
  - a search bar will allow you to speed up the process for looking a specific person.(Only employee with US alphabetic letter can be searched at the moment.)
